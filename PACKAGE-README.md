## 🐛 Known Issues

### **Hebrew Version (`index-with-hebrew.html`):**

**Issue 1: Map Disappears**
- When switching to Hebrew, map doesn't render correctly
- **Root cause:** Direction change affects Leaflet container size
- **Fix needed:** Add `map.invalidateSize()` after direction change with proper timing

**Issue 2: Header Layout**
- Language toggle button too large
- Doesn't fit well with other buttons
- **Fix needed:** Reduce button size, use only flag emoji

**Recommendation:** Don't deploy Hebrew version until fixed.
